  description: "Cluster-Within consistency Auto-CoT baseline (self-consistency only)"
  
  # Demo construction parameters
  n_pool: 1000  # Sample from training set
  n_clusters: 8  # Diversity clustering
  candidates_per_cluster: 10  # Top M closest to centroid
  
  # Sampling parameters for CW
  n_samples: 5  # Forward CoT samples (single mode)
  temperature: 0.7  # For diverse sampling during demo construction
  
  # Acceptance threshold
  tau_cw: 0.6  # Within-mode consistency threshold p >= tau_cw
  
  # Reasoning mode (single prompt)
  prompt: "Think step by step to solve this problem. End your response with 'Final answer: [your numeric answer]'."
